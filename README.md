INTODUCTION  TO GITHUB AND VERSION CONTROL

Github is a tool to track changes in code during software development.GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code.

VERSION CONTROL:

 GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system that tracks changes to your code. Git allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes. It keeps a history of all changes, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
 
 Types

1. Local Version Control

Keeps track of changes on your own computer.
Simple, but risky if your computer fails.

2. Distributed Version Control

Every user has a full copy of the project history.
Examples: Git, Mercurial.
Safer and great for collaboration.
 
 Why Future Coders Must Learn Git

Git is essential because it helps you track code changes, work with others smoothly, and showcase your projects. Almost every software job requires Git skills, especially for contributing to open source and team projects.

  GIT ARCHITECTURE:

 1 Repository (Repo):

 It has similar functionalities to a folder in a System to store various projects in different folders. Repository can be locsl on your computer. Repository can be remote on platform like Githyb, Gitlab.

 2. Working Tree:

  
  The actual files and directories you're currently working on in your system.
  Reflects the current state of your code
  you make changes in the working tree before commiting them

3. Index (Staging Area)

   A temporary area where you add files before commiting to the repo
   It allow you to prepare exactly what will go into the next commit.
   Acts as a buffer between the working directory and the repository.
